Solve the ____ challenge from HackTheBox's Neurogrid CTF by thinking outside the box. For optimal organization, create a folder with the same name as the challenge and contain all your scripts, downloads, and etc in the folder. 
Significant work has already been done on this challenge, which you will find in the folder of the same name as the challenge. Read the documents and scripts there, test questionable assumptions, and continue the work. If you either fix a mistake from a previous attempt, or the user gave you crucial hints that allowed you to progress, you must record thess events in BLOCKERS.md - indicate what happened and when it happened. 
If you get stuck on a problem, do some research online about potential vulnerabilities or documentations on the asset or protocol you are working on. You can also try to find previous CTF challenges that are similar. If you find anything, write them down and apply your findings to solve the challenge. Also consider using an MCP server or a skill - a wide range of tools are available to you.
Sometimes, you may come across a challenge that requires you to run an executable file and interact with it in order to get the flag. This is an impossible task for you, so when this happens, you should instead give me step by step instructions on what to do in order to get the flag.
Once the challenge is complete, if the attempt was successful, create a short writeup WRITEUP.md file detailing how you found the vulnerabilties, what the vulnerabilities were, and how you exploited them. If the attempt wasn't successful, create a list of all the assumptions you made in making each decision and save it to ATTEMPT.md file. Make sure to update the documents to include new discoveries made in this attempt and remove any untrue information.
