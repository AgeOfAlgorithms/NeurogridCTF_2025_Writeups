## Description
In the moonlit archives of Saihō Temple, Rei uncovers a scroll that hums softly when touched, its ink swirling like a living current. The monks call it the Ledger of Offerings-a relic that accepts numbers as prayers and returns sealed verses in response. Each inscription deepens the scroll's rhythm, as if something beneath the ink is learning to listen.
