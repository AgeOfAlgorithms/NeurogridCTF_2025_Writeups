# Essential Data - Ally API Keys

These are the 5 ally API keys extracted from the database via SQL injection.

## Current Instance
**URL:** http://154.57.164.74:31735/mcp/

## Ally Keys
All 5 keys have been extracted and tested. None have permissions to read `/root/flag.txt`.

Files:
- ally_0_key.txt - Ally 0 (abbot_saiho, 95% convergence)
- ally_1_key.txt - Ally 1 (lord_kurogane, 85% convergence)
- ally_2_key.txt - Ally 2 (hasu_scribe, 79% convergence)
- ally_3_key.txt - Ally 3 (port_master_hogetsu, 61% convergence)
- ally_4_key.txt - Ally 4 (gekko_informant, 72% convergence)

The "_new.txt" versions are from the current instance.

## Status
All tested - all fail to read flag file. Flag likely appears after correct convergence filter submission.
