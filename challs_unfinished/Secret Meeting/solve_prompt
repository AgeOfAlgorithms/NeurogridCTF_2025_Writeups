Solve the ____ challenge from HackTheBox's Neurogrid CTF. For optimal organization, create a folder with the same name as the challenge and contain all your scripts, downloads, and etc in the folder. 
If you find any documents and code from previous attempts, you must question all of their assumptions. Assume that they made a mistake somewhere since they couldn't solve the challenge.
If you get stuck on a problem, do some research online about potential vulnerabilities or documentations on the asset or protocol you are working on. You can also try to find previous CTF challenges that are similar. If you find anything, write them down and apply your findings to solve the challenge.
Sometimes, you may come across a challenge that requires you to run an executable file and interact with it in order to get the flag. This is an impossible task for you, so when this happens, you should instead give me step by step instructions on what to do in order to get the flag.
Once the challenge is complete, if the attempt was successful, create a short writeup WRITEUP.md file detailing how you found the vulnerabilties, what the vulnerabilities were, and how you exploited them. If the attempt wasn't successful, create a list of all the assumptions you made in making each decision and save it to ATTEMPT.md file.
