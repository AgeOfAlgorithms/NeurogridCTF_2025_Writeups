## 🎯 Current Status

**Instance:** http://154.57.164.74:31735/mcp/

**Blocking Issue:** Cannot determine correct convergence filter format

**Target:** Echo 7 (ONLY "Raw" echo)
- Corruption 12: Sentiment / Whimsy
- Corruption 13: Principle / Anarchy (Anti-Authority)

**Tried:** 100+ different filter object formats - ALL FAILED

**Needed:** Either:
- Insight into expected protocol format
- Different interpretation of user hints
- Alternative attack vector

## 🚀 To Continue

2. Check if instance is still alive: `python3 keep_alive.py`
3. Review **DEADLOCK_STATUS.md** for what's been tried
4. Try new approach based on fresh insight
