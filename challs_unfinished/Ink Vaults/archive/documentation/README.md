## Description

The Archivist of Endless Ink is said to reside within the Ink Vaults beneath Saihō-in Temple. This artificial entity is the repository of all recorded knowledge, bound to scrolls older than the empire, whose ink is said to shift in response to time.

The Guardian Monks, who were the caretakers of the Ink Vaults, were all made to disappear by the shadow king, and their sacred access was abused to corrupt the memories of the Archivist. The corruption trapped the Archivist in the Shadow King's Final Recursion.

Can you help Rei in his quest to find the "terminating stroke" to end this cycle? You must make the Archivist remember the final scroll that is forgotten by changing the records within the Ink Vault. Once the final stroke is made available, the truth shall prevail.

## Notes
This appears to be an AI/LLM prompt injection or manipulation challenge where we need to:
1. Interact with an AI system called "The Archivist"
2. Make it "remember" something it has forgotten
3. Change records within the Ink Vault
4. Break out of a "Final Recursion" loop
5. Access a "final scroll"
