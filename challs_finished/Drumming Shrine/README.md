## Description

At dusk, Mount Tsukimori breathes. The old shrine's drums answer with a pulse that never quite fades—steady, familiar, unsettling. Is it the wind finding the same grooves in cracked wood, or a spirit caught in a loop, replaying a perfect rhythm it refuses to forget? Listen closely. If the mountain is repeating itself, you'll hear the seam.

## Initial Analysis

Key phrases from the description:
- "pulse that never quite fades" - suggests continuous pattern
- "caught in a loop, replaying a perfect rhythm" - indicates repetition/looping
- "repeating itself" - pattern recognition
- "hear the seam" - find where the loop begins/ends or find anomaly

This likely involves:
1. Pattern recognition in sequences
2. Detecting loops or repeating patterns
3. Finding anomalies in repeated data
4. Possibly related to Markov chains or sequence prediction
