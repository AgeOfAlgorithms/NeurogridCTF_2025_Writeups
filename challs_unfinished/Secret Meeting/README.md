## Description
After a silent raid on a hillside shrine, Shiori is called to examine the suspect's abandoned workstation, its drives wiped clean, its trails burned to silence. Yet the forest remembers what men forget. Within the machine's shadow copies, she traces the faint echoes of deleted files, fragments of a conversation that should not exist. Deep beneath layers of encryption lies an application, sealed like a lacquered box, its contents whispering of hidden meetings and names long erased. To reveal the truth, Shiori must coax the past from its own reflection, recover what was meant to vanish, decrypt what was meant to remain unheard, and expose the voice behind the silence.

## Flags
1. When was the private communications application installed? Provide the exact installation timestamp in UTC (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).
2. It seems Khalid took steps to cover his tracks. A forensic review of the system reveals he used a tool specifically designed to erase digital evidence. What tool did he use?
3. Investigators located a previous system snapshot of Khalid's machine, preserving data before his deletion attempt. When was this snapshot saved? Provide the exact timestamp in UTC.
4. What is the meeting ID for Khalid's meeting?
5. How long did Khalid remain in the meeting? Provide the duration in seconds.
